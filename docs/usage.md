# Usage of Stellar XDR

## Serialization Example

```python
1 from src.xdr_serializer import XDRSerializer
2 
3 data = {...}  # Your data here
4 serialized_data = XDRSerializer.serialize(data)
```

### Validation Example

```python
1 from src.xdr_validator import XDRValidator
2 
3 is_valid = XDRValidator.validate(data)
```


### Conclusion

By implementing these advanced features, the `stellar-xdr` project can become a more robust and user-friendly library for developers working with the Stellar network. Each of these components enhances the functionality and usability of the library, making it easier to integrate and work with XDR data structures.
